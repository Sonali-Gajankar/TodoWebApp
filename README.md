## **"The Synch" - A ToDo web app**

"The Synch" is a ToDo website built using Django, HTML, CSS and Postgresql.
The application comes with a simple, easy to navigate interface for creating and maintaining tasks.

The website is built from scratch and is a project undertaken to gain practical experience in building a website.  
This has been a very interesting project to venture into understanding what all components and factors are important in building a website.
Starting with research into what the look and feel of the website should be right upto the storage of data has been both rewarding and frustrating.

Everything from designing the UI to understanding UX and attempting to convert it into a usable application has been done by me.
Both html and css were new to me and hence an active decision was made to not include javascript in this application. This was purely done, so I could first understand the basics of html and css while learning django before moving on to javascript.

The application design was created using figma and translated using pure html and css.
All the server side requests are made using HTTP calls and are handled using django framework.
I used postgresql as the backend for this application.

The website is fully designed to be an out of the ordinary looking site and is my vision. 
Thank you for checking out my work and taking the time to read about the app.
